# Time-Sheet-Calculator
A webpage to calculate total work hours in a day and in a week using HTML, CSS and Javascript

## About this project
In this web development project I have created a timesheet calculator web application using HTML CSS and JavaScript.

The web application will calculate the amount of worked hours, then subtracting break hours from it, calculate the amount of hours worked in one day.

You can calculate amount of hours worked for a single day or for whole week.
